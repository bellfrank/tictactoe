    <a href="/draw"><h3><strong>Draw</strong></h3></a>
    <p>Created using <strong>SVG's</strong>(Scalalabe vector graphics) and <strong>D3JS</strong> library to interact with the vector graphics.
        Points are drawn on a screen using the mouse x and y coordinates.
        Some of the obstacles I ran into had to do with browsers in general and that they can only fire events every so many milliseconds. To combat this I fill in lines between dots creating the illusion of smooth strokes when drawing. </p>

    <a href="/quiz"><h3><strong>Quiz</strong></h3></a>
    <p>Implemented using <strong>JavaScript</strong> to modify the DOM entirely client side.</p>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <a href="/flashcards"><h3><strong>Flashcards</strong></h3></a>
    <p>Implemented using <strong>REACT</strong> which is a declarative style of coding (this is what I want it to look like, you figure it out).
        It uses JSX instead of JavaScript. I also use Babel to translate <strong>JSX -> JavaScript </strong>since most browsers don't understand JSX.
        In REACT we have to think about our application in components and states, and how those components are going to behave. What makes REACT powerful is
        if you change the state, the view also changes.
    </p>
    <p><strong style="color: red;">Known Bugs:</strong> Currently working on a feature using <strong style="color: red;">componentDidMount</strong> that allows us to store data in browsers when user exits or refreshes page.
        I need to reconsider my approach since browsers tend to store information in Local Storage as a string and need to parse and stringify my data acoordingly.
